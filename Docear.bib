  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel evaluation methodology to analyze the delay of a wormhole routing based NoC with variable link capacities and a variable number of virtual channels per link. This methodology can be utilized to analyze different heterogeneous NoC architectures and traffic scenarios for which no analysis framework has been developed before. In particular, it can replace computationally-extensive simulations at the inner-loop of the link capacities and virtual channels allocation steps of the NoC topology optimization process. Our analysis introduces a set of implicit equations which can be efficiently solved iteratively. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation by comparing the analysis results to a simulation model for several use-cases and synthetic examples. In addition, we compare the analysis with simulation results for a chip-multi-processor (CMP) using SPLASH-2 and PARSEC traces for both homogeneous and heterogeneous NoC configurations.},

Often presented as a (min,+) filtering theory by analogy with the (+,x) filtering of traditional system theory, it makes use a well-defined set of operations. Their algorithmic aspects have not been much addressed. For this reason, we describe and analyze in a previous report a set of algorithms implementing these Network Calculus operations for a well-chosen class of functions. During this work, we had to construct some examples and counterexamples in order to draw the limits of our results or to illustrate them. Many of them have been omitted in that report and are now presented in this companion-paper.}},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a framework for characterizing service disciplines in terms of service burstiness. A wide range of service disciplines recently proposed for high-speed integrated services networks fall within this unifying framework. We introduce dynamic burstiness measures, and use them to describe the relationship between the burstiness of traffic entering a server, the burstiness of traffic exiting a server, the service burstiness of a server, and queueing delay. This relationship can be exploited to characterize end-to-end network delay in terms of the burstiness of traffic sources, the burstiness of traffic arriving at destinations, and the servi.ce burstiness of the servers which comprise the network. In addition, new classes of service disciplines are presented which support delay guarantees as well as efficient statistical sharing.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>We present a path selection algorithm that is used when deploying hard real-time traffic flows onto a chip- multiprocessor system. This chip-multiprocessor system uses a priority-based real-time network-on-chip interconnect between the multiple processors. The problem we address is the following: given a mapping of the tasks onto a chip-multiprocessor system, we need to determine the paths that the traffic flows take such that the flows meet there deadlines. Furthermore, we must ensure that the deadline is met even in the presence of direct and indirect interference from other flows sharing network links on the path. To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a link-level analysis to determine the impact of a link being used by a flow, and its affect on other flows sharing the link. Our experimental results show that we can improve schedulability by about 8\% and 15\% over Minimum Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Admission control is a procedure to guarantee a given level of Quality of Service (QoS) by accepting or rejecting arrival connection requests. There are many studies on backlog or loss rate evaluation formulas for admission control at a single node. However, there are few studies on end-to-end evaluation formulas suitable for admission control. In a previous paper, the authors proposed a new stochastic network calculus for many flows using an approach taken from large deviations techniques and obtained asymptotic end-to-end evaluation formulas for output burstiness and backlog. In this paper, we apply this stochastic network calculus to a heterogeneous tandem network with many forwarding flows and cross traffic flows constrained by leaky buckets, and obtain a simple evaluation formula for the end-to-end backlog. In this formula, the end-to-end backlog can be evaluated by the traffic load at the bottle neck node. This result leads us to a natural extension of the evaluation formula for a single node.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new foundational approach to reason about available bandwidth estimation as the analysis of a min-plus linear system. The available bandwidth of a link or complete path is expressed in terms of a service curve, which is a function that appears in the network calculus to express the service available to a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a sequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of arrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of estimating available bandwidth from measurements of network probes are related to potential nonlinearities of the underlying network. When networks are viewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a nonlinear regime, it is argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the network crosses from a linear to a nonlinear regime. Experiments on the Emulab testbed at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, evaluate the robustness of the system-theoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multinode experiments evaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides estimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual links.},

  Abstract                 = {Many classes of applications require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from the system interconnect. In Networks-on-Chip (NoC) QoS guarantees usually translate into bandwidth and latency constraints for the traffic flows and require hardware support in the NoC fabric and its interfaces. In this article we present a novel NoC synthesis framework to automatically build networks that meet hard latency constraints of end-to-end traffic streams without requiring specialized hardware for the network components. The hard latency constraints are met by carefully designing the NoC topology and selecting the appropriate routes for flow using lean best-effort network components. We perform experiments on several System on Chip (SoC) benchmarks. We compared against a topology synthesis method with no support for real-time constraints and we show that the proposed method can produce topologies that can meet significantly tighter worst case latency constraints (on average 44\%). We also show that the tightest worst case latency can be provided with little overhead on power consumption (on average 8.5\%).},

  Abstract                 = {{During the last two decades, starting with the seminal work by Cruz, network calculus has evolved as a new theory for the performance analysis of networked systems. In contrast to classical queueing theory, it deals with performance bounds instead of average values and thus has been the theoretical basis of quality of service proposals such as the IETF's Integrated and Differentiated Services architectures. Besides these it has, however, recently seen many other application scenarios as, for example, wireless sensor networks, switched Ethernets, avionic networks, Systems-on-Chip, or even to speed-up simulations, to name a few. In this article, we extend network calculus by adding a new versatile modeling element: a demultiplexer. Conventionally, demultiplexing has been either neglected or assumed to be static, i.e., fixed at the setup time of a network. This is restrictive for many potential applications of network calculus. For example, a load balancing based on current link loads in a network could not be modeled with conventional network calculus means. Our demultiplexing element is based on stochastic scaling. Stochastic scaling allows one to put probabilistic bounds on how a flow is split inside the network. Fundamental results on network calculus with stochastic scaling are therefore derived in this work. We illustrate the benefits of the demultiplexer in a sample application of uncertain load balancing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes an adaptive video smoothing and rebuffering algorithm for video transmission in best-effort, low-bandwidth networks. Our algorithm, which is derived from a ``dynamic{''} extension of the network calculus, (1) detects whether playback disruptions are inevitable and, if so, schedules a rebuffering action with minimal rebuffering delay and (2) computes a conservative transmission schedule that ensures continuous playback while minimizing consumption of network available bandwidth. NS-2 simulation results show that, compared to an aggressive transmission strategy, our method can greatly reduce bandwidth consumption and, compared to a simple rebuffering strategy with the same bandwidth consumption, our method can effectively reduce total playback delay while also reducing the number of rebuffering events.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the passive all-optical polarization switch, which modulates light with light. That switch is used to construct all the binary logic gates of two or more inputs. We discuss the design concepts and the operation of the AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates as examples. The rest of the 16 logic gates are similarly designed. Cascading of such gates is straightforward as we show and discuss. Cascading in itself does not require a power source, but feedback at this stage of development does. The design and operation of an SR Latch is presented as one of the popular basic sequential devices used for memory cells. That completes the essential components of an all-optical polarization digital processor. The speed of such devices is well above 10 GHz for bulk implementations and is much higher for chip-size implementations. In addition, the presented devices do have the four essential characteristics previously thought unique to the microelectronic ones.},

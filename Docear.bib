	be utilized to analyze different heterogeneous NoC architectures
	and traffic scenarios for which no analysis framework has been developed
	before. In particular, it can replace computationally-extensive simulations
	at the inner-loop of the link capacities and virtual channels allocation
	steps of the NoC topology optimization process. Our analysis introduces
	a set of implicit equations which can be efficiently solved iteratively.
	We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation by comparing the
	analysis results to a simulation model for several use-cases and
	synthetic examples. In addition, we compare the analysis with simulation
	results for a chip-multi-processor (CMP) using SPLASH-2 and PARSEC
	traces for both homogeneous and heterogeneous NoC configurations.},

  abstract = {{This paper collects a serie of examples and counterexamples encountered
	in the study of the algorithmics of Network Calculus operations.
	Network Calculus is a deterministic queuing theory which aims at
	providing bounds on the performances of communication networks thanks
	to a nice formalization in (min,+) algebra. Often presented as a
	(min,+) filtering theory by analogy with the (+,x) filtering of traditional
	system theory, it makes use a well-defined set of operations. Their
	algorithmic aspects have not been much addressed. For this reason,
	we describe and analyze in a previous report a set of algorithms
	implementing these Network Calculus operations for a well-chosen
	class of functions. During this work, we had to construct some examples
	and counterexamples in order to draw the limits of our results or
	to illustrate them. Many of them have been omitted in that report
	and are now presented in this companion-paper.}},

	terms of service burstiness. A wide range of service disciplines
	recently proposed for high-speed integrated services networks fall
	within this unifying framework. We introduce dynamic burstiness measures,
	and use them to describe the relationship between the burstiness
	of traffic entering a server, the burstiness of traffic exiting a
	server, the service burstiness of a server, and queueing delay. This
	relationship can be exploited to characterize end-to-end network
	delay in terms of the burstiness of traffic sources, the burstiness
	of traffic arriving at destinations, and the servi.ce burstiness
	of the servers which comprise the network. In addition, new classes
	of service disciplines are presented which support delay guarantees
	as well as efficient statistical sharing.},

	hard real-time traffic flows onto a chip- multiprocessor system.
	This chip-multiprocessor system uses a priority-based real-time network-on-chip
	interconnect between the multiple processors. The problem we address
	is the following: given a mapping of the tasks onto a chip-multiprocessor
	system, we need to determine the paths that the traffic flows take
	such that the flows meet there deadlines. Furthermore, we must ensure
	that the deadline is met even in the presence of direct and indirect
	interference from other flows sharing network links on the path.
	To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a link-level analysis to
	determine the impact of a link being used by a flow, and its affect
	on other flows sharing the link. Our experimental results show that
	we can improve schedulability by about 8\% and 15\% over Minimum
	Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively.</p>},

  abstract = {Admission control is a procedure to guarantee a given level of Quality
	of Service (QoS) by accepting or rejecting arrival connection requests.
	There are many studies on backlog or loss rate evaluation formulas
	for admission control at a single node. However, there are few studies
	on end-to-end evaluation formulas suitable for admission control.
	In a previous paper, the authors proposed a new stochastic network
	calculus for many flows using an approach taken from large deviations
	techniques and obtained asymptotic end-to-end evaluation formulas
	for output burstiness and backlog. In this paper, we apply this stochastic
	network calculus to a heterogeneous tandem network with many forwarding
	flows and cross traffic flows constrained by leaky buckets, and obtain
	a simple evaluation formula for the end-to-end backlog. In this formula,
	the end-to-end backlog can be evaluated by the traffic load at the
	bottle neck node. This result leads us to a natural extension of
	the evaluation formula for a single node.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new foundational approach to reason about available
	bandwidth estimation as the analysis of a min-plus linear system.
	The available bandwidth of a link or complete path is expressed in
	terms of a service curve, which is a function that appears in the
	network calculus to express the service available to a traffic flow.
	The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a sequence
	of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of arrivals.
	It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived
	in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further
	mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties
	of estimating available bandwidth from measurements of network probes
	are related to potential nonlinearities of the underlying network.
	When networks are viewed as systems that operate either in a linear
	or in a nonlinear regime, it is argued that probing schemes extract
	the most information at a point when the network crosses from a linear
	to a nonlinear regime. Experiments on the Emulab testbed at the University
	of Utah, Salt Lake City, evaluate the robustness of the system-theoretic
	interpretation of networks in practice. Multinode experiments evaluate
	how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides
	estimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of
	individual links.},

  abstract = {Many classes of applications require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees
	from the system interconnect. In Networks-on-Chip (NoC) QoS guarantees
	usually translate into bandwidth and latency constraints for the
	traffic flows and require hardware support in the NoC fabric and
	its interfaces. In this article we present a novel NoC synthesis
	framework to automatically build networks that meet hard latency
	constraints of end-to-end traffic streams without requiring specialized
	hardware for the network components. The hard latency constraints
	are met by carefully designing the NoC topology and selecting the
	appropriate routes for flow using lean best-effort network components.
	We perform experiments on several System on Chip (SoC) benchmarks.
	We compared against a topology synthesis method with no support for
	real-time constraints and we show that the proposed method can produce
	topologies that can meet significantly tighter worst case latency
	constraints (on average 44\%). We also show that the tightest worst
	case latency can be provided with little overhead on power consumption
	(on average 8.5\%).},

  abstract = {{During the last two decades, starting with the seminal work by Cruz,
	network calculus has evolved as a new theory for the performance
	analysis of networked systems. In contrast to classical queueing
	theory, it deals with performance bounds instead of average values
	and thus has been the theoretical basis of quality of service proposals
	such as the IETF's Integrated and Differentiated Services architectures.
	Besides these it has, however, recently seen many other application
	scenarios as, for example, wireless sensor networks, switched Ethernets,
	avionic networks, Systems-on-Chip, or even to speed-up simulations,
	to name a few. In this article, we extend network calculus by adding
	a new versatile modeling element: a demultiplexer. Conventionally,
	demultiplexing has been either neglected or assumed to be static,
	i.e., fixed at the setup time of a network. This is restrictive for
	many potential applications of network calculus. For example, a load
	balancing based on current link loads in a network could not be modeled
	with conventional network calculus means. Our demultiplexing element
	is based on stochastic scaling. Stochastic scaling allows one to
	put probabilistic bounds on how a flow is split inside the network.
	Fundamental results on network calculus with stochastic scaling are
	therefore derived in this work. We illustrate the benefits of the
	demultiplexer in a sample application of uncertain load balancing.

  abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive video smoothing and rebuffering algorithm
	for video transmission in best-effort, low-bandwidth networks. Our
	algorithm, which is derived from a ``dynamic{''} extension of the
	network calculus, (1) detects whether playback disruptions are inevitable
	and, if so, schedules a rebuffering action with minimal rebuffering
	delay and (2) computes a conservative transmission schedule that
	ensures continuous playback while minimizing consumption of network
	available bandwidth. NS-2 simulation results show that, compared
	to an aggressive transmission strategy, our method can greatly reduce
	bandwidth consumption and, compared to a simple rebuffering strategy
	with the same bandwidth consumption, our method can effectively reduce
	total playback delay while also reducing the number of rebuffering
	events. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	and the operation of the AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates as examples.
	The rest of the 16 logic gates are similarly designed. Cascading
	of such gates is straightforward as we show and discuss. Cascading
	in itself does not require a power source, but feedback at this stage
	of development does. The design and operation of an SR Latch is presented
	as one of the popular basic sequential devices used for memory cells.
	That completes the essential components of an all-optical polarization
	digital processor. The speed of such devices is well above 10 GHz
	for bulk implementations and is much higher for chip-size implementations.
	In addition, the presented devices do have the four essential characteristics
	previously thought unique to the microelectronic ones.},

	Generating Function,MGF)对到达曲线和服务曲线进行描述,文中给出了一种基于指数上鞅的端到端时延界表达式.该时延界不仅可以线性扩展,而且数值分析结果表明,在相同假设条件下,该时延界比现有的线性时延界具有更好的紧致性.},
